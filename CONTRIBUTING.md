# Contributing to IssueHunter

Greetings, fellow code adventurers! We're thrilled to have you on board to help make IssueHunter even more legendary. üöÄ‚ú®

Before you embark on your coding quest, let's take a look at how you can create an issue and contribute to the magic.

## Branching Strategy

- **Main Branch**: Our main branch is where the heart of the code beats. However, please refrain from direct commits to it. All your coding spells should be cast on feature branches.

- **Feature Branches**: When it's time to add a new feature, vanquish a troublesome bug, or weave any code magic, create a feature branch for your quest. Let your branch name be descriptive, like 'add-issue-filters' or 'fix-wand-bug.'

- **Pull Requests**: Once your magical work is complete, craft a pull request. ü™Ñ Pull requests are where the real conjuring begins. Explain the purpose of your contribution, and our guardians (reviewers) will meticulously inspect your work. Collaborate, iterate, and together, we'll create the most extraordinary enchantments.

- **Rebasing**: Ensure your feature branch aligns with the main branch by performing a rebasing ritual before submitting your pull request. This ensures your changes blend seamlessly with the latest incantations from the main branch.

## Getting Started

If you're new to the world of open source or IssueHunter's mystical domain, here's how you can start your adventure:

1. Begin by forking the repository to your GitHub sanctuary.

2. Summon the code to your local realm by cloning your forked repository.

3. Forge a feature branch (as described earlier).

4. Conjure your code magic, making your changes wondrous and powerful.

5. Present your feature branch to your forked repository.

6. When you're prepared to share your enchantments, cast a pull request spell.

7. Collaborate with fellow wizards and witches to refine your work and bring it to its full potential.

## Creating an Issue

**Creating an issue is a powerful ritual** that helps us track and manage improvements, enhancements, and bug fixes. Follow these steps to create an issue:

1. **Navigate to the Issues tab** at the top of the repository.

2. **Click on the "New Issue" button.**

3. In the issue template, provide a **clear and concise title** that describes the quest or problem.

4. In the description, **provide detailed information** about the issue. Include any relevant context, steps to reproduce, and expected behavior.

5. If applicable, **attach screenshots or code snippets** to help illustrate the issue.

6. Assign **labels** to categorize the issue, such as "bug," "enhancement," or "feature request."

7. Add any relevant **milestones** to track progress.

8. If you're so inclined, **assign yourself** to the issue to signify your intent to work on it.

9. When everything's in order, **click "Submit new issue"** to cast your issue into the repository.

## Documentation

If your magical changes involve altering any documentation (like this one), kindly update it. Having clear and up-to-date documentation is like having a map to the treasures of the code.

## Happy Questing!

Thank you for joining our grand adventure! Together, we can make IssueHunter even more legendary and awe-inspiring for our users. If you have questions or seek guidance, don't hesitate to ask in the GitHub issues or reach out to our mystical maintainers.

Now, embark on your coding quest, and may your pull requests be as legendary as the tales of old, and your code as powerful as the ancient scrolls of wizards! üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ú®
