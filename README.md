IssueHunter is the ultimate GitHub issue search wizard! It's like having your own personal issue-hunting sidekick, here to help you search for GitHub issues with ninja-like efficiency. Whether you're a coding wizard or a project management sorcerer, IssueHunter's got your back!


## Features

- **Effortless Issue Discovery**: Search and discover GitHub issues in the blink of an eye.

## Getting Started

Alrighty then, let's get you set up with IssueHunter, your trusty issue-searching sidekick. Follow these steps to get started:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js: If you don't have Node.js installed, grab it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). You'll need it to run IssueHunter.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/NewtonFernandis/IssueHunter.git
   ```

2. Dive into the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd IssueHunter
   ```

3. Time to summon the dependencies:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration

IssueHunter is thirsty for a GitHub personal access token. Here's how to feed it:

1. Create your very own GitHub personal access token by following [these mystical instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).

2. Now, concoct a `.env` file in the project's root and pour in your access token like so:

   ```shell
   GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-access-token-here
   ```

### Running the Development Server

Ready to wield your issue-hunting powers? Fire up the development server with this spell:

```shell
npm run dev
```

Your browser will become your trusty crystal ball, guiding you to IssueHunter at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Build for Production

When you're ready to showcase your magical GitHub issue-finding skills to the world, use this command to craft your production masterpiece:

```shell
npm run build
```

This will summon an optimized production build in the `dist` directory.
